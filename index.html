    <h2> About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi my name is Cole, thank you for coming to my site. I graduated highschool in 2019 and I worked for Costco for nearly three years.
        During my time at Costco I learned that I wanted to seek a profession that envolved computers in some way. I spend alot of time on the computer and I want to further my career regarding this field. I have always had a passion for technology and I would like to further my education with it.
